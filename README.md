Hi.  This CLI program should ask the user what activity they are interested in doing in the Portland OR area.
Next it will list the best spots found on the web for that activity.
After that, the user can then pinpoint one place of interest and learn more about it.
It will then ask if the user wants info aboutu any other spot.
Also, it will give the user the option to go back to the activity selection as well.
