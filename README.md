Hi.  This CLI program should ask the user what activity they are interested in doing in the Portland OR area.
Next it will list the best spots found on the web for that activity.
After that, the user can then pinpoint one place of interest and learn more about it.
It will then ask if the user wants info aboutu any other spot.
Also, it will give the user the option to go back to the activity selection as well.


INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS: 
Simply Download the file from Github to your computer.  Save it somewhere that you'll remember.

HOW TO USE:
1. Open up terminal or Command Prompt and type cd /your_location_of_my_project
2. Make sure you have Ruby Installed on your computer - if the next step doesn't work then google installing Ruby on your OS.
3. Once your inside of pdx-outdoor in Terminal or Command Prompt type ruby main.rb  and press enter
4. After that, the command line interface should begin working and you'll be prompted with nearly 3 main activities and a range of 10-30 options within those.  You always maintain the ability to go back to the initial choice by typing back.
5. Get out there and enjoy those outdoor activities (If you live in/around/or visit Portland Or).
